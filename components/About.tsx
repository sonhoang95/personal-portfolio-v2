            Hello! My name is Brittany and I enjoy creating things that live on
            the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012
            when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out
            hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML &
            CSS!
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at an
            advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a
            student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building
            accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at
            Upstatement for a variety of clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to
            build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.
          </p>
          <p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
        </div>
        <div className="relative">
          <Image
            src={selfPortrait}
            alt="self-portrait"
            className="z-10 rounded-lg"
          />
          <div className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-[300px] border-2 border-teal-400 z-0 transform translate-x-5 translate-y-5 rounded-lg"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
  );

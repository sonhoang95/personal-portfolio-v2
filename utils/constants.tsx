        Hello! My name is Son and I enjoy creating things that live on the
        internet. My interest in web development started back in 2020 when my
        brother asked me to help him design and develop a marketing campaign for
        his startup â€” turns out hacking together a simple landing page taught me
        a lot about HTML & CSS!

        I'm currently learning backend development, security with the interest
        to become a full-stack developer. On top of that, I'm also exploring
        Test Driven Development with Jest and React Testing Library.

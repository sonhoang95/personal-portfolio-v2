        Hello! My name is Son and I enjoy creating things that live on the
        internet. My interest in web development started back in 2020 when my
        brother asked me to help him design and develop a marketing campaign for
        his startup â€” turns out hacking together a simple landing page taught me
        a lot about HTML & CSS!
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at an{' '}
        <span className="text-teal-300"> a start-up</span>, and{' '}
        <span className="text-teal-300">a corporation</span>. My main focus
        these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital
        experiences at{' '}

        for a variety of clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently learning backend development, security with the interest
        to become a full-stack developer. On top of that, I'm also learning
        about Test Driven Development methodology because I want my code to work
        the way it's intended.

      <p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
